Features flags
==============

Some host-installer features are not enabled by default, and
downstream installers can activate them by creating a file in
/etc/xensource/features/ in their installer filesystem.

Currently available feature flags are:

  supplemental-packs

    Support installation of supplemental packs after installation of
    the main product.

    This only impacts the UI, the <source> answerfile construct still
    allows to include supplemental packs without this feature flag.

    This also has no impact if users previously load a driver disk:
    they will get the opportunity to insert it again to get the driver
    installed on the host.
