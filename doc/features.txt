Features flags
==============

Some host-installer features are not enabled by default, and
downstream installers can activate them by creating a file in
/etc/xensource/features/ in their installer filesystem.

Currently available feature flags are:

  raid-assemble

    Detect Linux software-RAID (a.k.a "md") superblocks in disks, adds
    a choice for the user to activate software RAID volumes, and do
    not offer the user the ability to upgrade or restore a system on a
    software-RAID device.

    This only impacts the UI, the <assemble-raid/> answerfile
    construct does not need this feature flag.
